    <h4>SCENE II.--HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES,
        BRINDAVOINE, LA MERLUCHE..</h4>
    


           <h6 class="HAR">HAR.</h6>
           <p class="speech"> 
            To you, Brindavoine, and to you, La Merluche, belongs the duty of
            washing the glasses, and of giving to drink, but only when people are
            thirsty, and not according to the custom of certain impertinent
            lackeys, who urge them to drink, and put the idea into their heads
            when they are not thinking about it. Wait until you have been asked
            several times, and remember always to have plenty of water..</p>

            

            <h6 class="LAMER">LA MER.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            Shall we take off our smocks, Sir? </p>
          
            <h6 class="HAR">HAR.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            Yes, when you see the guests coming; but be very careful not to
            poil your clothes.</p>

            <h6 class="BRIND">BRIND.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            You know, Sir,<br>
            that one of the fronts of my doublet is covered
            with a large stain of oil from the lamp.<br></p>

            <h6 class="LAMER">LA MER.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            And I, Sir, that my breeches are all torn behind, and that,<br>
            saving your presence ...</p>

            <h6 class="HAR">HAR.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            Peace! Turn carefully towards the wall, and
            always face the company. (_To_ BRINDAVOINE, _showing him how he is to
            hold his hat before his doublet, to hide the stain of oil_) And you,
            always hold your hat in this fashion when you wait on the guests.<br></p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            MAR. What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what<br>
            I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely<br>
            to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what<br>
            is modest and seemly.</p>

            <h6 class="HAR">HAR.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            But still?</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
                To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her
                manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,
                her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.
                Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must
                have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any
                other.</p>
